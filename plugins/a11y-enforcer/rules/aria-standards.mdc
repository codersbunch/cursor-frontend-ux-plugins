alwaysApply: true

accessibility-standards:

- Use semantic HTML elements (button, nav, main, header, footer) instead of div with roles
- Every image must have a descriptive alt attribute (empty alt="" for decorative images)
- All form inputs must have associated label elements (not just placeholder text)
- Interactive elements must be keyboard accessible and have visible focus indicators
- Color alone must not convey meaning - use icons, text, or patterns alongside color
- Minimum contrast ratio: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text (WCAG AA)
- All videos must have captions, all audio must have transcripts
- Never use positive tabindex values - use DOM order for tab sequence
- Modal dialogs must trap focus and return focus on close
- Dynamic content changes must be announced via aria-live regions
