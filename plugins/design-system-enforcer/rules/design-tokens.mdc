description: Design token and component usage standards for consistent UI
alwaysApply: true
---

design-system-standards:

- Always use design tokens for colors, spacing, typography - never hardcode hex values or px sizes
- Use components from the design system library - never build custom versions of existing components
- Spacing must use the 4px grid system (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64px)
- Colors must reference token names (e.g., color.primary.500) not raw values (#3B82F6)
- Typography must use defined text styles (heading-lg, body-md) not arbitrary font sizes
- Icons must come from the approved icon library - no ad-hoc SVGs
- Never override design system component styles with !important
- Component variants must match defined variants in the design system - no one-off styles
